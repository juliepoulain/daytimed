## ABOUT

Welcome to DayTimed! The app to help you micromanage yourself.

DayTimed allows you to employ methods such as the pomodoro method, or any custom variation, to help you get your tasks done in a timed manner. 

This type of timed task management can help individuals with depression, ADHD, or just those who enjoy timing themselves!

Daytimed was built with a react front end and python backend with sqlalchemy and flask.
